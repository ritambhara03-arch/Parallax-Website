            <h2 class="sec">Adventure Time!</h2>
            <p class="text">Adventure is a thrilling experience which increases the excitement and the rush of adrenaline in the blood. It also refers to an activity that is exciting, exhilarating and having some element of risk. Mountain bike riding, Para gliding, swimming, parachute jumping, and dirt racing are some of the examples of adventurous activities. Adventure is often pursued for psychological improvement and also to gain knowledge and experiences as in case of exploration and jungle safaris. Adventure involves risk yet people long for it because of the boost it gives to one’s confidence and mood. It is surely good to be adventurous unless it is done after carefully analyzing the risk involved.</p>
            <p class="text">Adventure is the experience of some exciting activities. It is the unusual experience which comes from the activities full of courage, excitement and joy. It never thinks about the result. It may result positively which gives some benefits and negatively which hurts and make losses.</p>

                <h2 class="des">BIKING</h2></div>
                <p class="text">Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes.
                    If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice.You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike.
                    If you’re a beginner, choose a flat bike path or road. If you’re ready for a tougher workout that also engages your upper body and core, try mountain biking. It’s also called off-road biking. You can do it on trails and different types of rough terrain.</p>
                <p class="text"> Mountain biking is trickier because you have to navigate hills and surfaces, so your upper body and core will kick into gear. It’s more of a total-body workout than biking on the road, which is mostly a lower-body cardio workout.</p>
            <div class="bg bg2">
                <h2 class="des">PARA GLIDING</h2></div>
                <p class="text">Paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.The pilot is suspended in a seated harness and controls the wing via lines attached to the trailing edge of the paraglider. These lines may be operated individually to turn the paraglider or simultaneously to influence pitch and speed. Takeoff and landing are on foot and usually occur on a hill or mountain.<p><p class="text">Paragliders use lifting air (thermals) in exactly the same way as other gliding aircraft, although their low speed precludes their use in strong winds. Using thermal lift, soaring flights of 100 miles (160 km) are common. In competition pilots fly routes to distant goals, recording their progress by aerial photographs or GPS (Global Positioning System) traces. </p>
                  <div class="bg bg3">
                    <h2 class="des">SURFING</h2></div>
                    <p class="text">Surfing’s roots lie in premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the sport was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Early European explorers and travelers praised the skills of Hawaiian surfers, but 19th-century missionaries assigned to the islands disapproved of the “constant intermingling, without any restraint, of persons of both sexes” and banned the pastime. Surfing was practiced only sporadically in Hawaii by the end of the 19th century.In the early 20th century, however, concomitant with the development of Hawaii as a tourist destination, surfing underwent a revival, and the sport quickly spread to California and Australia.</p>
                    <p class="text">Professional surfing has not captured the public’s interest and has struggled to secure sponsors. Its tournaments vary in number, location, and sponsorship every year. </p>
